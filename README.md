# VitaLoader Redux
A Ghidra extension for PlayStation¬ÆVita reverse engineers!
This extension contains a loader for ELF-PRX modules, MeP-c5 processor and helper scripts.

## Features 
Redux can be used in place of the ELF loader provided by Ghidra to load executables in ELF-PRX format targeting the PlayStation¬ÆVita platform. **This loader does NOT support standard ELF executables - only use it for ELFs in PRX format.**

- Loads ELF files with SCE types (`ET_SCE_EXEC`, `ET_SCE_RELEXEC`, `ET_SCE_PSP2RELEXEC`) and standard types (`ET_REL`, `ET_EXEC`, `ET_CORE` ***in PRX format***)
- Locates and marks up all module entrypoints
  - `module_start`
  - `module_stop`
  - `module_exit`
  - `module_bootstart`
  - `module_suspend`
  - `module_proc_create`
  - `module_proc_exit`
  - `module_proc_kill`
- Locates, marks up and parses `NONAME` exports
  - `SceModuleInfo`
  - `SceProcessParam` and subfields
    - `SceLibcParam` including Malloc Replacement
  - Module thread parameters
  - DTrace probes
  - SDK version (displayed in `About Program` window)
- Locates and marks up all imports and exports
  - Imports are separated based on the module from which they are imported
  - Allows automatic renaming of symbols using NID databases

### New features
#### NID Analyzer
Naming of imports and exports using a NID database is no longer performed at import time. Use the new `NID Resolution` analyzer instead. Analysis can be performed multiple times with different database files.

The database used for analysis can be changed in the analyzer's settings (`Analysis > Auto Analyze '<program name>'` and select `NID Resolution`).

The following database sources are available:
- `Builtin` is a [curated database file](data/BuiltinNIDDatabase.yaml) bundled with the extension
  - Once the extension is installed, the file can be found at `%USERPROFILE%\.ghidra\<Ghidra version>\Extensions\VitaLoaderRedux\data`
  - **This file is deleted when the VitaLoader Redux extension is uninstalled!**
  - *At the moment, the built-in database is mostly empty.*
- `External` is a database file chosen by the user via a file picker dialog
- `Environment` is a database file chosen by the user via an environment variable
  - Set the `VLR_DATABASE_PATH` environment variable to the path of the file you wish to use as a NID database to enable this source
  - **If the environment variable is not set or contains an invalid path, this database source will not be displayed**

The default database source is `Environment` if available, and `Builtin` otherwise.

To apply NIDs from multiple databases successively, untick the `Clear old names` setting.

**NOTE:** Names from the database are automatically demangled using the GNU Demangler.

#### Variable import relocation
Variable imports are now supported and handled properly! This also applies to function-as-variable imports.
A special memory block is created to "store" all imported variables, and relocations are applied so that all code inside the module that accesses them will access them inside the special memory block.

*The variable import memory block can be customized at import time by clicking on the `Options...` button in the Import dialog. (The dialog where `Executable Type` is selected)*

Due to the way relocation is performed, certain code patterns will confuse the decompiler.
For example, C code that should read as
```c
if (&sceWeaklyImportedFunction != NULL) {
   sceWeaklyImportedFunction();
}
```
will transform info something similar to
```c
if (true) {
   sceWeaklyImportedFunction();
}
```
i.e. the condition will always evaluate to 1.

However, the assembly will now hold a reference to the import thunk, which can be used to figure out what the properly decompiled code should look like.
**Users should always be wary of `if (true)` and `if (false)` tests as they usually hide a subtlety the decompiler is unable to recover.**
Note that the affected code patterns are seen only in a few modules (e.g. `SceDisplay`), so this limitation should not be an issue for most reverse engineering tasks.

#### Utility scripts
Can be found in the *Script Manager* under the `Vita` category.
- `MapRAMForNSKBL.py`
  - Adds LPDDR2TOP in the memory map and merge it with NSKBL (`nskbl.bin`)
  - Fixes missing references to `.bss` section and other stuff
- `AddHardwareDevices.py`
  - Adds several hardware devices in the memory map
  - Useful for reverse engineering of code running without MMU on (SKBL, NSKBL, CMeP binaries)
- `FixupVLRImportThunks.java`
  - Renames all function import thunks to the systematic name
  - This allows linking across modules with the systematic names which are more stable

#### MeP-c5 support
- Original idea from [ghidra-mep](https://github.com/xyzz/ghidra-mep) by xyz
  - **Written from scratch**
  - *`ghidra-mep` used as reference (along with Ghidra "samples") for tricky points*
- Implements most of the MeP-c4 instruction set
  - Coprocessor-modulo instructions are not implemented
  - MeP-c5 instructions are not implemented (except `PREF`)
  - The `CACHE` instruction is implemented
    - **This fixes `halt_baddata()` in some CMeP binaries!**
- IVC2 coprocessor (i.e. Venezia core) is not implemented

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CreepNT/VitaLoaderRedux/releases/latest) for the Ghidra version you use.
Open Ghidra, select `File` > `Install Extensions...`, click on the green `+` and select the `.zip` file you just downloaded.
A dialog asking you to restart Ghidra should appear, do so in order to complete the installation.

## Updating
~~Open Ghidra, select `File` > `Install Extensions...` and untick the checkbox next to `VitaLoaderRedux`.~~ This step may be unnecessary.
Close Ghidra and follow the [install instructions](#Installation) again.

## Building
[Install Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) then run `gradle` in a command prompt.
Make sure to pass `-PGHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<path to Ghidra install>` if the environment variable `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` is not set.

**Building the extension for a version of Ghidra earlier than 10.3 is not supported.**

## Bug reports
Please report any error encountered with Redux in the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/CreepNT/VitaLoaderRedux/issues).

Before submitting any bug report:
- Read this file **very carefully**!!!
- Update to the latest version of the extension
- Make sure you are importing an ELF file **in PRX format**
  - Regular ELF files are **not** supported by this loader!
- If you are not able to load a file (`ARM ELF-PRX for PlayStation¬ÆVita` is not displayed in the `Executable Type` list): ***please verify that your executable is not malformed***.

### Known bugs / issues / limiations

* Running the `Demangler GNU` analyzer breaks import thunks
  * Workaround: do not use the `Demangler DNU` analyzer.
  * The `NID Analyzer` will automatically demangle imports and exports
  * Other symbols can be demangled using scripting

## Future plans
The following features might be implemented in Redux:
- Add missing structures (e.g. smaller `SceLibcParam`)
- Symbol parsing
- Object file support (`.o` files)
- Unwind tables parsing
  - *if it might be useful for C++ binaries reversing, which I doubt*
- Full MeP-c5 implementation
- Venezia (MeP + IVC2) support

## FAQ

#### Q. Attempting to navigate from a module to another using the import thunk results in a `Symbol [<library>_<NID>] does not exist` error

Ghidra was not able to find the label in exporting module.

Make sure that:
* the label exists in the program (it should be placed on the exported function/variable)
* the label is in the `Global` namespace
	* Moving the label in another namespace is a common mistake when creating new Primary labels
	* Place the cursor on the label in listing and press the `L` key to show (and modify) its namespace

In general, running the NID Analyzer with `Delete old names` options should fix this issue.
(**Be careful!** All labels applied to imports and exports will be deleted!)

Running the `FixupVLRImportThunks.java` script may also fix the issue if the program was analyzed using an old version of VitaLoaderRedux.
